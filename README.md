# Python-Password-Generator-w-TKinter-GUI
Simple password generator with GUI made in TKinter. This is a beginners project and is in no way perfect.

#This is a placeholder Readme, as I'm not adept at making proper Readme files as of yet. 

What does this program do?
It generates a password on the basis of users choice of security (basic, medium, extra) and lenght.

BASIC will generate a password that consists of lowercase and uppercase letters.
MEDIUM will generate a password that consists of numbers and upper and lowercase letters.
EXTRA will generate a passsword that consists of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and basic symbols.

Password lenght is limited to minimum of 8 and maximum of 24 characters. Why? Because it's reasonable (I think).

You need Python 3.6 to run this code.
I will probably upload an .exe file in the future, that can run this without Python installed. 

What comes SOONâ„¢?

Changes to UI.
Copy-able password result.
Better readable fonts.

After that?

I still have a bunch of stuff that could use a GUI. Basic math calculator, BMI calculator, Hangman game, etc. I'll upload them to GitHub in due time!
